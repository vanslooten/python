Demonstration of OOP with bouncing balls using Pygame

Instructions:
1. Make sure you have Python installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install pygame by running the following command in your terminal:
   pip install pygame
3. Run this file to start the bouncing balls demo:
   python Bounce.py
You can modify Ball.py and Bounce.py to experiment with OOP concepts.

Prompts used:
1. Create a simple Ball class in Ball.py that can be used to demonstrate pure object oriented principles
to students. It is Ok to use Pygame. Then create a class Bounce in Bounce.py that creates a Window
in which Balls are being launched at random intervals and with random properties (color, size, speed).
The balls bounce onto the sides of the Window.

2. Add documentation by comments in both files, for each function. Add general instructions to the top
of Bounce.py on how to get started (eg. installing pygame with pip)

3. Change the game background to white and allow the window to be resized and to go to full screen mode.
